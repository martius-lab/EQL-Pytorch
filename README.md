# EQL-Pytorch
 
This repo contains an implementation of the [EQL](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/sahoo18a.html) in PyTorch.

# Running the exmaples

First generate data by running  `python3 gen_data.py`.
Then run the training by `python3 run.py`. You'll find a file called
`func.txt` that contains the final expression.
